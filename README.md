# Machine-Learning

This repository includes a solution I wrote to a classic Machine Learning problem which uses the well known MNIST handwritten digits dataset.
This Artificial Neural Network (ANN) classifier classifies hand-written images of the digits 0-9.

The Artificial Neural Network's Topology is 784 inputs, 16 hidden nodes, and 10 output nodes.

The stock price analysis tool uses data available as a csv file at: https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/csv/download-data
The output provides an interesting look into how stock prices correlate between companies.
