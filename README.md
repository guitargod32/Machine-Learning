# Machine-Learning

This is a solution I wrote to a classic Machine Learning problem which uses the well known MNIST handwritten digits dataset.
This Artificial Neural Network (ANN) classifier classifies hand-written images of the digits 0-9.

The Artificial Neural Network's Topology is 784 inputs, 16 hidden nodes, and 10 output nodes.
